Hello World!

Today is day 4 of a 10 day livestream to build an MVP for Leet UX, a design education platform for developers.

We went into further detail in clarifying who we're building the platform for, by completing a persona exercise, as well as locking in a plan for launch.

I built this site, too, so I can capture updates for the stream related activites in one place.
