Today marked day 5 of the 10 day sprint to build Design Mentor.

I managed to get through some important deep work: I completed a rough draft of the copy for the landing page, which then allowed me to finish off a good wireframe for it, too.

Armed with both, I then go stuck into finding some inspiring designs to collect on a moodboard. The design style I'm aiming for is bold and typogrpahically large.

Finally, I gave some design crit and created some mockups based off of it.
