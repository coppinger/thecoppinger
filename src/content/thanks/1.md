Rhys reached out to me on Twitter after I posted about Design Mentor for the first time.

He mentioned that he'd create a Figma file a few years ago that was a small experiment on the kind of content I'm planning for Design Mentor, and the experiment went well.

This kind of stuff is great to knowm, and the file itself is an excellent reference. Thanks Rhys ðŸ«¡
